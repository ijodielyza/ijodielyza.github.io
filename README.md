<h1> My friends are weird. </h1>

<p> My name is Jodie Hitosis. I have weird friends. </p>

<h2? The question is: How weird are they? </h2>

<p class="one"> There are many different types of <a href="#weirdHumans">friends</a> I have. They come from a select range of being completely polite, to absolutely rude, to absolutely fun. Most of the times they combine together into 
different sorts of friends. </p>

<p> Some of them can be so weird, they can  be known for things like making weird <a href="#poems">peoms or rhymes,</a> or even <a href="#weirdThings">say weird things,</a> period. </p>

<p class="one"> I've known a handful of these friends since the times of Elementary school, from a range of kindergarten to fifth grade. </p>

<p> So, speaking of types of friends--they can range from being rude, stupid, smart, clumsy, slick, loud, quiet, nice, fun, and boring. I know it's kind of wrong to favor one person more than the other, but 
I usually like the fun people I've known for a while a <em> tad </em> bit more than others.</p>

<p class="one"> I figured that a lot of my "lovely" friends, would also probably like to see their name on this
small webpage, as I waste their time. Yes, I am wasting your time by having you read this crap. Why did you even come here anyway? Because, I don't know, maybe you like, went over to my computer during class? Or like, got this one link by accident.</p>
